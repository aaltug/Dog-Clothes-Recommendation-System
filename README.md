Abstract

This project aims to develop a system that offers suggestions by analyzing the color and pattern similarities of individuals' personal clothing combinations and their dogs' clothes using convolutional neural networks (CNN). This system aims to analyze users' combinations and dog clothes and offer personalized suggestions based on the color, pattern and style similarity of the two. The recommendation system visually processes the user's personal combinations and dog clothes and determines the similarities with the convolutional neural networks method. By using machine learning and image processing techniques, this study aims to help users find clothes that fit their personal style and match their dog's style. It also aims to provide a practical solution by making it easier for pet owners to match clothing and dog clothes.
